# Skej - "Send me your skej" - Privacy-first ENS calendar scheduling infra on Zirkuit for the AI Agent Economy


## 🏆 Competition Submission
Note: The epics and app code are from an alternative implementation idea and not relevant.

**One-sentence description:** Skej is a decentralized scheduling protocol that enables privacy-preserving meeting coordination between ENS addresses using ZK proofs on Zircuit, with token payments for premium scheduling features and AI agent services.

**Why we should win:** Skej solves the trillion-dollar scheduling coordination problem with true Web3 principles while creating the first privacy-first scheduling infrastructure specifically designed for the emerging AI agent economy - leveraging all of Zircuit's unique capabilities like speed, low costs and Ethereum securities.

## Problem Statement

### The Current Scheduling Crisis
- **$541 billion lost annually** due to poor meeting coordination and scheduling inefficiencies
- **Centralized scheduling platforms** (Calendly, Doodle) own your data and limit interoperability
- **Privacy violations**: Current solutions expose entire calendar contents to coordinate single meetings
- **AI agents increasingly need scheduling** but lack decentralized, cost-effective coordination mechanisms
- **Web3 identity systems** (ENS) have no native scheduling layer, forcing users back to Web2 tools

### Specific Pain Points
1. **Privacy Paradox**: To find mutual availability, both parties must expose their full calendars
2. **Platform Lock-in**: Scheduling data trapped in centralized silos
3. **AI Agent Barriers**: High gas costs and centralized APIs prevent autonomous agent scheduling
4. **Identity Fragmentation**: ENS identities can't directly coordinate scheduling
5. **No Value Exchange**: Current systems don't enable paid/premium scheduling services

---

## Solution: Skej Protocol

### Core Innovation
Skej creates a **privacy-first scheduling layer** for ENS addresses using Zircuit's ZK rollup capabilities, enabling:
- **Zero-knowledge availability matching** without revealing full calendars
- **Decentralized coordination** through blockchain events and IPFS
- **Base token payments** for premium scheduling features
- **AI agent optimization** with low-cost, high-frequency interactions

### Leveraging Zircuit's Unique Capabilities

#### 1. Sequencer Level Security
- **AI-enabled fraud detection** prevents scheduling spam and manipulation
- **Enhanced security** for high-value business meetings and contracts
- **Trust minimization** for autonomous agent interactions

#### 2. Account Abstraction Support
- **Gasless scheduling** for end users (sponsors pay gas in Base tokens)
- **Batch operations** for AI agents managing multiple calendars
- **Smart wallet integration** for seamless UX

#### 3. Network Performance
- **Sub-second scheduling** confirmation vs. minutes on Ethereum L1
- **Cost efficiency**: $0.01 vs $50+ per scheduling interaction
- **High throughput** supporting enterprise-scale scheduling coordination

   - Meeting confirmed on Zircuit with ZK proof

3. **Privacy Guarantees**
   - Neither party sees other's full calendar
   - Only mutual free slots revealed
   - Meeting details encrypted per party
   - Blockchain records only proof-of-meeting

### User Journey: AI Agents

1. **Autonomous Setup**
   - Deploy with ENS identity (scheduler-ai.eth)
   - Configure scheduling preferences via smart contract
   - Maintain Base token balance for operations

2. **Scheduling Automation**
   - Monitor Zircuit events for scheduling requests
   - Generate ZK proofs of availability automatically
   - Execute complex scheduling logic (multi-party, recurring)
   - Charge Base tokens for premium AI scheduling services

3. **Cross-Agent Coordination**
